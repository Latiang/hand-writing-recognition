# Hand Writing Recognition with Machine Learning using Python 3 and Numpy
This project aims to implement a machine learning system from scratch (with the help of Numpy) for recognizing hand-written letters using the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

## Dependencies (Python 3):  
**Numpy** - for fast Python arrays and math `pip3 install numpy`  
**Pillow** - Image handling and display `pip3 install numpy`
